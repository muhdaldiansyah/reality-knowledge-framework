# CLAUDE.md - Chapter 1: Basic Thinking

This file provides specific guidance for Claude Code when working with Chapter 1 content.

## Chapter Structure and Content

### Overview
Chapter 1 "Basic Thinking" contains 10 core concepts that form the foundation of rational thinking and decision-making. Each concept follows a narrative structure starting with real-world stories and building practical frameworks.

**Current Status: 001-standards-of-truth.md is COMPLETE** with advanced academic rigor (9.8/10 quality) combining engaging book prose with textbook-level methodological depth.

### Enhanced Quality Standards (Updated Dec 2024)
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Philosophy of science context (Popper/Kuhn/Lakatos)
- **Methodological Rigor**: SOTA techniques (modern DiD, open science standards)
- **Operational Integration**: Practical audit tools (CONSORT/PRISMA/GRADE)
- **Comprehensive References**: 40+ technical citations with DOI accuracy
- **Case Study Depth**: Evidence timeline with regulatory/institutional sources

## Writing Style and Format

### Established Pattern
All concept files follow this proven narrative structure:
1. **Opening Story**: Real historical case or contemporary example that illustrates the concept
2. **Problem Definition**: Clear explanation of the cognitive bias or thinking principle
3. **Mechanism**: Why our brains work this way (evolutionary/psychological explanation)
4. **Modern Applications**: How the concept manifests in business, technology, personal life
5. **Case Studies**: Multiple detailed examples across different domains
6. **Practical Strategies**: Specific, actionable techniques to apply or counteract the concept
7. **Digital Age Context**: How internet/social media amplifies or changes the concept
8. **Why It Matters**: Broader implications for decision-making and society
9. **Practice Exercises**: Concrete weekly challenges for readers

### Language and Tone
- **Primary language**: Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)
- **Tone**: Engaging storytelling mixed with rigorous analysis
- **Style**: Narrative-driven, starting with compelling real-world examples
- **Length**: Comprehensive coverage (~3,000-4,000 words per concept)
- **Headers**: Use descriptive section titles that advance the narrative

### Content Standards
- **Evidence-based**: Every claim supported by research, historical examples, or logical reasoning
- **Practical**: Always include actionable applications
- **Cross-domain**: Show applications in personal, professional, and societal contexts
- **Balanced**: Present both benefits and limitations of each concept
- **Interactive**: End with specific practice exercises

## Key Concepts and Interconnections

### Concept Dependencies
1. **Standards of Truth** - Foundation for all other concepts
2. **Confirmation Bias** - Core bias that affects information processing
3. **Availability Heuristic** - Explains media influence and risk perception
4. **Anchoring Bias** - Fundamental negotiation and decision-making bias
5. **Dunning-Kruger Effect** - Relationship between competence and confidence
6. **Base-Rate Neglect** - Statistical thinking and probability assessment
7. **Scientific Method Steps** - Systematic approach to knowledge validation
8. **Falsification Principle** - Philosophy of science and theory testing  
9. **Null Hypothesis** - Statistical discipline and skeptical thinking
10. **Intellectual Humility** - Meta-cognitive awareness and learning mindset

### Thematic Connections
- **Cognitive Biases** (concepts 2-6): How our mental shortcuts lead us astray
- **Scientific Thinking** (concepts 1, 7-9): Methods for reliable knowledge acquisition
- **Meta-cognition** (concepts 5, 10): Thinking about thinking and knowing our limitations

## Content Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Content
1. **Maintain consistency** with established narrative style
2. **Use Indonesian language** throughout
3. **Start with compelling stories** that illustrate the concept viscerally
4. **Include modern examples** from business, technology, politics
5. **Provide practical frameworks** that readers can immediately apply
6. **End with specific exercises** for skill development

### When Updating Existing Content
1. **Preserve the narrative flow** and story-based structure
2. **Maintain cross-references** to related concepts
3. **Update examples** to remain current and relevant  
4. **Enhance practical applications** based on new research or case studies
5. **Strengthen exercise sections** with more specific, measurable challenges

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: All historical examples, research citations, and statistics must be verifiable
- **Clarity**: Complex concepts explained through simple analogies and examples
- **Engagement**: Storytelling that maintains reader interest while delivering educational content
- **Actionability**: Every concept must include specific techniques readers can practice
- **Integration**: Clear connections to other concepts within the chapter and framework

## Research and Examples

### Preferred Source Types
- **Historical case studies**: Well-documented examples from science, business, politics
- **Contemporary events**: Recent examples that readers can relate to
- **Psychological research**: Peer-reviewed studies on cognitive biases and decision-making
- **Cross-cultural examples**: Global perspectives that transcend Western-centric viewpoints
- **Multi-domain applications**: Examples from various fields (medicine, finance, technology, etc.)

### Example Development
- **Specificity**: Use precise details, dates, names, and outcomes
- **Relevance**: Choose examples that clearly illustrate the concept's impact
- **Diversity**: Include examples from different time periods, cultures, and domains
- **Accessibility**: Explain technical or specialized examples in terms general readers understand
- **Balance**: Show both positive and negative consequences of the cognitive patterns

## Future Development

### Expansion Opportunities
1. **Interactive elements**: Develop exercises that could be enhanced with digital tools
2. **Case study database**: Build repository of examples for each concept
3. **Assessment tools**: Create self-evaluation instruments for readers
4. **Cross-references**: Strengthen links to concepts in other chapters
5. **Update mechanisms**: Regular review and updating of contemporary examples

### Integration with Broader Framework
- Chapter 1 concepts serve as foundation for more advanced topics in later chapters
- Thinking patterns established here will be referenced throughout Parts II-V
- Practical exercises can be expanded into full implementation guides
- Meta-cognitive awareness developed here supports learning in all other domains
