# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the Reality Knowledge Framework (RKF) repository - a structured cross-disciplinary knowledge map containing 200 core concepts for understanding how the world works, sharpening thinking, and making better decisions. The framework is organized into 5 Parts, 20 Chapters, and 200 Core Concepts, all documented in Indonesian.

## Structure

The repository is currently documentation-only, containing:
- `README.md`: Complete framework documentation with all 200 concepts organized across 5 parts:
  - Part I: Foundations (40 concepts) - Basic thinking, logic, mathematical intuition, uncertainty
  - Part II: Causality (30 concepts) - Causal thinking, experiments, observational studies  
  - Part III: Systems (40 concepts) - System fundamentals, dynamics, networks, optimization
  - Part IV: Tools & Methods (50 concepts) - Data foundations, statistics, modeling, simulation, communication
  - Part V: Decisions & Action (40 concepts) - Decision frameworks, prioritization, implementation, ethics

## Content Language

All documentation is in Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia). When working with content from this repository, maintain the Indonesian language unless specifically requested to translate.

## Repository Purpose

This is a knowledge framework repository designed to provide structured thinking tools rather than executable code. Any future development should focus on:
- Expanding the conceptual framework
- Creating implementation examples for the 200 concepts
- Building educational materials or interactive tools based on the framework
- Maintaining the structured organization of concepts across the 5 parts
